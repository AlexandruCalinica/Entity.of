**Entity.of** ensures the data received over the wire matches your expectations. If it doesn't you'll know first.

- ### ðŸ•¸ Data inconsistency catcher
- ### ðŸ¦¾ Declarative API contract enforcer
- ### ðŸ›  Standardized object constructor

The motivation behind **Entity.of** comes from first degree encounters with broken APIs, out-of-date REST api documentations, unsynchronized graphql schemas + resolvers, third party services releasing breaking changes, and many more text-book or edge case situations causing bugs, unexplained behaviours, runtime errors and generally a bad user experience for end users.

# Mindset
Think about **Entity.of** as a sweet spot combination between **decorator pattern** and **type guard pattern**. The first one (decorator) is used to apply the second (type guard). There is also a third obvious component which without this library makes no sense - **ES6 Classes**.
