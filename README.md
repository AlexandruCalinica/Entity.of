**Entity.of** ensures the data received over the wire matches your expectations. If it doesn't you'll know first.

- ### ðŸ•¸ Data inconsistency catcher
- ### ðŸ¦¾ Declarative API contract enforcer
- ### ðŸ›  Standardized object constructor

# Motivation
**Entity.of** was born as a byproduct of first degree encounters with:
- broken APIs
- out-of-date REST api documentations
- unsynchronized graphql schemas + resolvers
- third party services releasing breaking changes
- and many more text-book or edge case situations causing bugs, unexplained behaviours, runtime errors and generally a bad user experience for end users of frontend web apps.

All backend services ideally implement some form of validation and sanitization for any incomming data.
Why should'nt we consider a similar approach for client applications?

# Mindset
Think about **Entity.of** as a sweet spot combination between **decorator pattern** and **type guard pattern**. The first one (decorator) is used to apply the second (type guard). There is also a third obvious component which without this library makes no sense - **ES6 Classes**.
